# blinkAboutGo
this is just like a dustbin about some blink during playing go <br>

it's a game about sharing, just like the real world or let's say, politics <br>
it only becomes more complex rather than other chess or card games, they become clearer,
and the only thing that constrains the complexity is the board. <br>

Whenever attacked or directly approached, We exposed our vulnerability ***simultaneously***.

The funny thing is that alphaGo or deep-mind are not built by play go; they learn the game pattern..

```But the average 150-move game contains more possible board configurations — 10170 — than there are atoms in the Universe, so it can’t be solved by algorithms that search exhaustively for the best move.```

**put thuo foolish mock to the rest**

 like "nothing but rely on its out-matched computing power to move the most possibility move"
