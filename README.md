# blinkAboutGo
this is just like a dustbin about some blink during playing go <br>

it's a game about sharing, just like the real world or let's say, politics <br>
it only becomes more complex rather than other chess or card games, they become clearer,
and the only thing that constrains the complexity is the board. <br>

Whenever attacked or directly approached, We exposed our vulnerability ***simultaneously***.
